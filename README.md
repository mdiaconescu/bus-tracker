# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
This is a programming exercise that demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript to create a real-time bus-tracking app. Specifically, this app is configured to track the locations of all the actively-running buses along the Downtown LA - Westwood Route. The location data updates every 15 seconds. 

The map style is currently set to "navigation-day-v1", which displays the current traffic density on the streets. By clicking on the location markers, a pop-up will appear with the bus number for each.

## Installation / Usage
Download all of the files within this repository, and load the index.html file in a web browser. This app can run while hosted either locally or on a remote web server. For a live preview, you can run the index.html file in this repo, directly, by visting this URL: https://mdiaconescu.github.io/bus-tracker/index.html

## Roadmap
- Replace the default location markers with custom markers showing a bus icon.
